  ros__parameters:
    replan_freq: 10.0  # unit: Hz
    dt: 0.1
    maximum_agents: 5  # maximum number of agents BRNE will consider (including the robot)
    n_samples: 196  # number of samples assigned to each agent. needs to be the square of an even number
    n_steps: 25  # time steps of the planning horizon
    max_lin_vel: 0.6  # 0.6,0.8 maximum linear velocity allowed on the robot
    max_ang_vel: 1.0  # 1.0,1.2 maximum angular velocity allowed on the robot
    nominal_lin_vel: 0.4  #0.4,0.5 nomimal (linear) velocity when plannig the initial trajectory
    open_space_velocity: 0.6  # nominal velocity when the robot is in open space
    kernel_a1: 0.2  # control the "straightness" of trajectory samples. Larger the value is, less straight the trajectory sample will be.
    kernel_a2: 0.2  # control the "width/spreadness" of trajectory samples. Larger the value is, more spread the trajectory samples are.
    # a1 probably makes safety zone narrower. try tuning a1 and a3
    cost_a1: 15.0  # control the safety zone, smaller the value is, more conversative the robot will be.
    cost_a2: 3.0  # control the safety zone, larger the value is, more conservative the robot will be.
    cost_a3: 20.0  #  control the safety penalty weight, larger the value is, more conservative the robot will be.
    ped_sample_scale: 0.1  # pedestrian's willingness for cooperation, default value is 1.0, the smaller it is, the less the robot would expect the pedestrians to make space for it
