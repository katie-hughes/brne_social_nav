# crowd_nav
Author: Katie Hughes

This is a ROS 2 package for setting up crowd navigation on a Unitree Go1 with the BRNE algorithm.


## ROS Nodes
* `brne_nav`: Implements BRNE using the C++ BRNE library.
* `controller`: Publishes the commands generated by `brne_nav`
* `pub_goal`: provides a service to manually set a specific goal pose. Useful if you want to test a precise goal location over and over but most of the time using the gui in RVIZ is good enough. 

## Launchfiles
* `algorithm.launch.xml`: Launches BRNE related nodes
* `crowdnav.launch.xml`: Core launchfile that launches visualizations (can be either real or simulated) and the BRNE algorithm nodes.
* `onboard.launch.xml`: Launchfile designed to run on the onboard laptop that launches ZED odometry/pedestrian tracking and BRNE algorithm nodes.
* `sim.launch.xml`: Run the BRNE pipeline completely in simulation, with imulated pedestrians and simulated odometry. This eliminates the need for the ZED for testing purposes. 
* `visualizations.launch.xml`: Just launches rviz with the appropriate configuration file for setting goal poses and viewing the results of the algorithm.
